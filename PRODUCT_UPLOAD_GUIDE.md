# Product Upload Guide

Use this checklist when adding products to Zaman Optics. Consistent product data is what makes collection filters, prescription mode, search, and order handling work correctly.

## Product Basics

Add these fields for every product:

| Field | What to Enter | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Title | Clear product name with shape/category | Visionary Square Eyeglasses |
| Vendor | Store or supplier name | Zaman Optics |
| Product type | Main selling category | Eyeglasses, Sunglasses, Blue Light Glasses, Kids Glasses |
| Description | Material, fit, use case, lens compatibility, care notes | Lightweight square acetate frame with prescription lens support |
| Price | Final frame price in PKR | Rs 2,500 |
| Compare-at price | Only if on sale | Rs 3,200 |
| SKU | Internal stock code | ZO-EYE-SQ-001-BLK |
| Inventory | Track stock where possible | 8 in stock |
| Collections | Add to the correct collection | Eyeglasses |
| Tags | Add fallback filter tags | Square, Acetate, Unisex, Medium |
| SEO title/meta | Short search-friendly copy | Square Eyeglasses in Pakistan - Zaman Optics |

## Product Images

Upload 4 to 6 images when possible:

1. Front product image on white or light gray background.
2. Angled product image. This becomes the hover image on collection cards.
3. Side/temple image.
4. Close-up of hinge/material.
5. Optional model or lifestyle image.
6. Optional packaging/accessories image.

Keep the first image clean and centered so the full frame is visible. The theme uses contained product images on collection cards, so transparent PNG or high-quality JPG/WebP files work well.

## Required Metafields

Create these product metafield definitions in Shopify Admin under **Settings > Custom data > Products**.

| Name | Namespace and key | Type | Values |
|---|---|---|---|
| Product Mode | `custom.product_mode` | Single line text | `prescription` or `standard` |
| Frame Shape | `custom.frame_shape` | Single line text | Round, Square, Rectangle, Aviator, Cat Eye |
| Material | `custom.material` | Single line text | Metal, Acetate, Plastic |
| Gender | `custom.gender` | Single line text | Men, Women, Unisex, Kids |
| Size | `custom.size` | Single line text | Small, Medium, Wide |

Use these values exactly so Search & Discovery filters stay clean.

## Recommended Extra Metafields

These are not required for the current theme, but they help customers and can be used later for richer product pages and filters.

| Name | Namespace and key | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frame Color | `custom.frame_color` | Single line text | Black |
| Lens Color | `custom.lens_color` | Single line text | Gray |
| Lens Width | `custom.lens_width` | Number integer | 52 |
| Bridge Width | `custom.bridge_width` | Number integer | 18 |
| Temple Length | `custom.temple_length` | Number integer | 140 |
| Rim Type | `custom.rim_type` | Single line text | Full Rim |
| Face Shape | `custom.face_shape` | Single line text | Oval, Round |
| Prescription Ready | `custom.prescription_ready` | True/false | true |

## Product Mode Rules

Use `custom.product_mode = prescription` for:

- Eyeglasses
- Blue Light Glasses
- Kids Glasses

Use `custom.product_mode = standard` for:

- Sunglasses

If a product is in the sunglasses collection, the theme should show the normal Shopify purchase buttons. If it is in prescription mode, the lens workflow appears and saves prescription/lens data as line item properties.

## Filter Setup

The collection sidebar now supports two filter systems:

1. **Shopify native filters** using Search & Discovery. This is the proper launch setup.
2. **Fallback tag filters** if Search & Discovery is not configured yet.

For the proper setup:

1. Install **Shopify Search & Discovery**.
2. Open **Search & Discovery > Filters**.
3. Add product metafield filters for:
   - `custom.frame_shape`
   - `custom.material`
   - `custom.gender`
   - `custom.size`
4. Keep Shopify price filter enabled.
5. Make sure every product has those metafield values filled.

For fallback filtering, also add tags that match the visible filter values exactly, for example:

```text
Square, Acetate, Unisex, Medium
```
